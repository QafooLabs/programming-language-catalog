E# is mainly based on ideas in SmallTalk, Python, Java and C# but it resembles the syntax of Java. E# combines message-based computation with Java-like syntax.","E# is an effort to create a programming language suitable for being embedded in various applications on various platforms. It aims to have a flexible architecture and a clean syntax while keeping the total size of the language under 1MB. E# is fully object oriented (anything is an object) with pure encapsulation (only private properties) and uses message passing to connect code actions.","E#'s syntax is most similar to Java, though it also bears some resemblance to Python and C#.
