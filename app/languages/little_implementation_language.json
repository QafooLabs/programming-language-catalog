{"name":"LIL","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Implementation_Language","description":["LIL, the Little Implementation Language, was a system programming language during the early days of Unix history on PDP-11 machines. It was written by P. J. Plauger of Bell Labs.","LIL attempted to fill the gap between assemblers and machine-independent system implementation languages (such as the C programming language), by basically adding structured programming to the PDP-11 assembly language. LIL resembled PL360 with C-like flow control syntax.","The LIL compiler \"lc\" was part of Fifth Edition Unix (1974), but was dropped by Sixth Edition Unix (1975). Plauger left Bell Labs in the same year.","Plauger explains why LIL was abandoned in Bell Labs in favor of C:","","",""]}
