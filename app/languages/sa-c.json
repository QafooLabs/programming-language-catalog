{"name":"SA-C","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SA-C_(programming_language)","description":["Single Assignment C (SA-C) (pronounced \"sassy\") is a member of the C programming language family designed to be directly and intuitively translatable into circuits, including FPGAs. To ease translation, SA-C does not include pointers and arithmetics thereon. To retain most of the expressiveness of C, SA-C instead features true n-dimensional arrays as first-class objects of the language."]}
