{"name":"ProvideX","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ProvideX","description":["ProvideX is a computer language and development environment derived from Business Basic (a business oriented derivative of BASIC) in the mid-1980s.","ProvideX is available on several operating systems (Unix\/Linux\/Windows\/Mac OS X) and includes not only the programming language but also file system, presentation layer interface, and other components. The language is primarily designed for use in the development of business applications. There are numerous companies using the technology as the basis for their application in markets such as distribution, property management, health care, transportation, etc.[citation needed] While primarily used in North America, there are developers around the world which use ProvideX.[citation needed]","Over the years since its inception and as the computer industry has changed, ProvideX has added functionality such as a graphical interface, client-server capabilities, access to external databases, web services, and, more recently, object oriented programming capabilities. The language has generally maintained compatibility with its roots; thus applications developed in ProvideX have been able to remain current even though the world of technology has changed.[citation needed]","On October 8, 2010, PVX Plus Technologies announced that it has assumed all ongoing sales, development, and support of the ProvideX product line for Independent Software Vendors. This brings the development of the language back under control of the original creator, Mike King and is the end result of almost 2 years of negotiations between Sage, EDIAS, and PVX Plus Technologies.","There are several websites available dedicated to ProvideX:",""]}
