{"name":"Draco","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Draco_(programming_language)","description":["Draco was a shareware programming language for CP\/M and the Amiga, created by Chris Gray in the early 1980s, and discontinued sometime around 1990.","Draco, a blend of Pascal, C and ALGOL 68, was a strongly typed language most notable for its ability to produce small, optimized executables, and for the compiler's ability to work in very limited memory spaces. Gray himself used Draco for the Amiga to create a port of Peter Langston's Empire game, called Amiga Empire.","There is a freeware Draco-to-C converter available at Aminet. Also, the source code of Draco (which is itself written in Draco) is now also available at Aminet."]}
