{"name":"NATURAL","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NATURAL","description":["Natural is a fourth-generation programming language from Software AG. It is largely used for building databases output in plain text form, for example.","It has the ESCAPE TOP flow control instruction, which is similar to continue in C, C++, Java and several other languages, except that it also works within subroutines to both return from the routine and then continue the calling statement's processing loop.","Like continue, it avoids large amounts of indentation levels when using nested instruction blocks inside any loop.","Example with ESCAPE TOP:","The levels of indentation can be automatically adjusted with the STRUCT command in the Natural Editor.","The same example, without ESCAPE TOP:","Another powerful flow control instruction command is the ESCAPE BOTTOM, which is similar to ESCAPE TOP except that it continues the processing from end of the calling statement's processing loop. Example with ESCAPE BOTTOM:","One trait that sets Natural apart from most other languages is its rich syntax. For example, many languages have a simple switch case statement that can be used to replace nested IF statements pertaining to a single variable; in C-like languages, it is prone to logic errors since it is necessary to BREAK out of the statement programatically. Natural has a much cleaner\/richer DECIDE statement which is easier to understand and code. Here is an example:"]}
