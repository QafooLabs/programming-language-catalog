{"name":"Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cach%C3%A9_ObjectScript","description":["Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript is a part of the Cach\u00e9 database system sold by InterSystems. The language is a functional superset of the ANSI-standard M (i.e. MUMPS) programming language. MUMPS programmers can run existing MUMPS routines under Cach\u00e9 with little or no change. Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript offers a number of additions to ANSI-standard M including integrated support for object-oriented programming, procedure and control blocks using { } syntax and relaxed whitespace limitations.","The language has private and public variables and globals. Global has a different meaning in this language than in most; it does not refer only to scope but also to permanence. Globals refer directly to items stored in the hierarchical database. Any global that is SET will retain its value across system shutdowns. Also, all globals have universal scope.","The scope of a private variable is the local function, the scope of a public variable is the entire process. Variables, private and public, may be single elements or complete multi-dimensional arrays.","An interesting characteristic of hierarchical databases is that the data is always sorted (basically the data structure is a B-tree). There are no sorting functions in the language itself. To sort data in a different order, you create a new array with different indices and copy the original array to the new one.","All arrays are \"sparse\". Space is only allocated for nodes that contain values. The arrays are multi-dimensional, but it is easiest to think of them as tree structures, not as linear or rectangular storage.","The original scripting language for Cach\u00e9, Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript is an object-oriented language. One interesting feature of Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript is that it enables the intermixing of data access methods \u2013 developers may view data as objects, as relational tables (using SQL), or as multidimensional arrays. Also, unlike some other object languages, Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript allows stand-alone routines. It does not require that all code be part of some object class method.",""]}
