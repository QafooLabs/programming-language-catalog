{"name":"Stateflow","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stateflow","description":["Stateflow, developed by MathWorks, is a control logic tool used to model reactive systems via state charts and flow diagrams within a Simulink model. Stateflow uses a variant of the finite-state machine notation established by David Harel, enabling the representation of hierarchy, parallelism and history within a state chart.","Stateflow is generally used to specify the discrete controller in the model of a hybrid system where the continuous dynamics (i.e., the behavior of the plant and environment) are specified using Simulink.","Specific applications for Stateflow include:","Stateflow can be used with other products to extend its capabilities beyond modeling and simulation. For example, using add-on code generation products, a Stateflow user can automatically generate C, HDL, and PLC code from a Stateflow chart."]}
