{"name":"Reia","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reia_(programming_language)","description":["Reia is a general-purpose concurrent object-oriented programming language for the Erlang virtual machine.","Reia supports multiple programming paradigms including imperative, functional, declarative, object oriented, and concurrent. It uses the actor model for concurrency in a manner that works alongside its object system. It uses pattern matching as the primary operation by which it selects branches to take and binds variables. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to Erlang, Ruby, and Python.",""]}
