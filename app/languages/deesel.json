{"name":"Deesel","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deesel","description":["Deesel, formerly called G, is a computer programming language; more specifically, a metaprogramming language based on the Java language, in much the same way that C++ is based on C, so Deesel is nearly a superset of Java.","Deesel is written by Neil Ellis and Troy Heninger.","It provides many new additions to Java, including the abilities to write sub-languages, and to program the parser using parslets. It supports a degree of type inference and implicit declaration of variables, and it has closures. It allows using named constructor slots, so that x=Constructor(a, b: c); is equivalent to x=Constructor(a); x.setB(c);. It also has string templates like Perl.",""]}
