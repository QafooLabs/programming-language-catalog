{"name":"UNITY","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/UNITY_(programming_language)","description":["UNITY is a programming language that was constructed by K. Mani Chandy and Jayadev Misra for their book Parallel Program Design: A Foundation. It is a rather theoretical language, which tries to focus on what, instead of where, when or how. The peculiar thing about the language is that it has no flow control. The statements in the program run in a random order, until none of the statements causes change if run. This allows for programs that run indefinitely (auto-pilot or power plant safety system) as well as programs that would normally terminate (which here converge to a fixed point).","All statements are assignments, and are separated by #. A statement can consist of multiple assignments, of the form a,b,c\u00a0:= x,y,z, or a\u00a0:= x || b\u00a0:= y || c\u00a0:= z. You can also have a quantified statement list, , where x and y are chosen randomly among the values that satisfy expression. A quantified assignment is similar. In , statement is executed simultaneously for all pairs of x and y that satisfy expression.","Bubble sort the array by comparing adjacent numbers, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Using  expected time,  processors and  expected work. The reason you only have expected time, is that k is always chosen randomly from . This can be fixed by flipping k manually.","You can sort in  time with rank-sort. You need  processors, and do  work.","Using the Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm all pairs shortest path algorithm, we include intermediate nodes iteratively, and get  time, using  processors and  work.","We can do this even faster. The following programs computes all pairs shortest path in  time, using  processors and  work.","After round , D[i,j] contains the length of the shortest path from  to  of length . In the next round, of length , and so on."]}
