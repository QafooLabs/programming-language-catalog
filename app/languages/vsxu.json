{"name":"VSXu","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/VSXu","description":["VSXu (VSX Ultra) is an OpenGL-based (hardware-accelerated), modular programming environment with its main purpose to visualize music and create 3D effects in real-time. Available for Windows and GNU\/Linux. It is currently released as free software under terms of the GNU General Public License v2 and maintained by Vovoid Software & Multimedia.VSXu is built on a modular plug-in-based architecture so anyone can extend it and or make visualization presets (\"visuals\" or \"states\").","VSXu is divided in 2 parts: VSXu Player and an Editor (VSXu Artiste). The player loads and runs the visuals created in Artiste.","In Artiste, the user interconnects modules visually represented as boxes with inputs and outputs. A module always produces something and has various parameters which in turn can be fed with the result of another module. There are about 200 different modules which can produce bitmaps, handle textures, generate 3d geometry (meshes) and render geometry.","There are also modules for reacting to sound, playing sound and reacting to joystick input.","VSXu implements a custom, minimalistic file format with LZMA compression and can compile visuals with 3d meshes and textures (JPEG or PNG) in the same file.","VSXu has its roots in the Sonique music visualization development community and was first conceived in 2001, then published in 2004. Main developers are Jonatan Wallmander, Robert Wenzel (better known as CoR) and Joakim F\u00e4nnick."]}
