{"name":"Fuxi","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fuxi_Programming_Language","description":["Fuxi (pronounced foo-shee) is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented, declarative programming language. It was designed for use in application and systems programming, and implemented to meet the demands of network computing and mobility, and to provide a vehicle for rapid prototyping of software. It intends to make programming enjoyable, through the well-designed combination of the best ideas found in object-oriented, concurrent, functional, and logical programming paradigms, and the embodiment of a design philosophy: simplicity, efficiency, uniformity and consistency with conventions. So, Fuxi adopts a syntactical system and an object model strongly influenced by major current languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java, though the language itself is more declarative.","Fuxi reflects the major aspects of Object-oriented programming, but differs from C++ and Java in that it differentiates methods into functions, clauses, and triggers, and gives them a uniform syntax through pattern matching. The notable language features include:","The following is a simple example of Fuxi, which calculates the Fibonacci numbers:","Fuxi Language Homepage"]}
