{"name":"Goo","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goo_(programming_language)","description":["GOO is a lexically scoped, dynamic, type-based, object-oriented programming language. It is designed to be simple, productive, powerful, extensible, dynamic, efficient and real-time. It heavily leverages features from many earlier languages. In particular, it attempts to be a simpler, more dynamic, lisp-syntaxed Dylan and an object-oriented Scheme. GOO's main goal is to offer the best of both scripting and delivery languages while at the same time incorporating an extreme back-to-basics philosophy.","It does not appear to be actively maintained; the last release available from the website was made in November 2003."]}
