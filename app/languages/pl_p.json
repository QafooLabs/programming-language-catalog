Certain PRIMOS modules written during PRIMOS's early years in Fortran IV were rewritten in PL\/P. PL\/P was the most widespread compiled programming language used for commercial PRIMOS applications, outpacing the use of the Prime C compiler, the CPL (PRIMOS) scripting language, and the Fortran IV compiler in commercial applications.",""]}
