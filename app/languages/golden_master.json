{"name":"GM","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_master","description":["","In hardware and software development, a golden master is the reference model from which copies are mass-produced. An analogy is made to the production of certain types of physical media. In that process, a mold is cast in gold, from which subsequent copies are derived.","The golden master is usually the release to manufacturing (RTM) version, and therefore the first public\/commercial version. It represents the development stage of \"RTM\" (Release To Manufacturing). Reaching this stage is said to be \"going gold\", or \"gone golden.\"","Apple Inc. has used the term in a document, first written in April 1988, describing its software versioning system.","The term is often confused with \"gold master\" which refers to a physical recording entity such as that sent to a manufacturing plant. Apple Inc. used the term in a press release written in March 2001 to describe the sending of a physical gold master disc to manufacturing.",""]}
