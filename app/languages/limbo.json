{"name":"Limbo","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Limbo_(programming_language)","description":["Limbo is a programming language for writing distributed systems and is the language used to write applications for the Inferno operating system. It was designed at Bell Labs by Sean Dorward, Phil Winterbottom, and Rob Pike.","The Limbo compiler generates architecture-independent object code which is then interpreted by the Dis virtual machine or compiled just before runtime to improve performance. Therefore all Limbo applications are completely portable across all Inferno platforms.","Limbo's approach to concurrency was inspired by Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).","Limbo supports the following features:","Limbo uses Ada-style definitions as in:","The 3rd edition of the Inferno operating system and Limbo programming language are described in the textbook Inferno Programming with Limbo ISBN 0-470-84352-7 (Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2003), by Phillip Stanley-Marbell. Another textbook \"The Inferno Programming Book: An Introduction to Programming for the Inferno Distributed System\", by Martin Atkins, Charles Forsyth, Rob Pike and Howard Trickey, was started, but never released."]}
