{"name":"A+","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A%2B_(programming_language)","description":["A+ is an array programming language descendent from the programming language A, which in turn was created to replace APL in 1988.Arthur Whitney developed the \"A\" portion of A+, while other developers at Morgan Stanley extended it, adding a graphical user interface and other language features. A+ was designed for numerically intensive applications, especially those found in financial applications. A+ runs on many Unix variants, including Linux. A+ is a high-level, interactive, interpreted language.","A+ provides an extended set of functions and operators, a graphical user interface with automatic synchronization of widgets and variables, asynchronous execution of functions associated with variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and other features. A newer graphical user interface has not yet been ported to all supported platforms.","The A+ language implements the following changes to the APL language:","Interactive A+ development is primarily done in the Xemacs editor, through extensions to the editor. Because A+ code uses the original APL symbols, displaying A+ requires a font with those special characters; a font called \"kapl\" is provided on the web site for that purpose.","Arthur Whitney went on to create the K language, a proprietary array language. Like J, K omits the APL character set. It does not have some of the perceived complexities of A+, such as the existence of statements and two different modes of syntax."]}
