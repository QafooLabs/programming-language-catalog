{"name":"Yorick","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yorick_(programming_language)","description":["Yorick is an interpreted programming language designed for numerics, graph plotting and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to array syntax, and extensible via C or Fortran routines. It was created in 1996 by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.","Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax.","Several elements can be accessed all at once:","Like \"theading\" in PDL (Perl Data Language) and \"broadcasting\" in Numpy (Numeric extension for Python), Yorick has a mechanism to do this:","\"..\" is a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array.","\"*\" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector.","Tensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick:","P(,+,,)*Q(,,+)","means ",""]}
