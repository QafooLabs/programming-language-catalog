{"name":"Id","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Id_(programming_language)","description":["Id is a general-purpose parallel programming language, developed by Arvind and Nikhil, at MIT, in the late 1970 and throughout the 1980s. The major subset of Id is a purely functional programming language with non-strict semantics. Features include: higher-order functions, a Milner-style statically type-checked polymorphic type system with overloading, user defined types and pattern matching, and prefix and infix operators. It led to the development of pH, a parallel dialect of Haskell.","Id programs are fine grained implicitly parallel.","The MVar synchronisation variable abstraction in Haskell is based on Id's M-structures.",""]}
