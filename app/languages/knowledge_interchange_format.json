{"name":"KIF","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knowledge_Interchange_Format","description":["Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a computer-oriented language for the interchange of knowledge among disparate computer programs.","It has declarative semantics (i.e., the meaning of expressions in the representation can be understood without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions); it is logically comprehensive (i.e. it provides for the expression of arbitrary sentences in the first-order predicate calculus); it provides for the representation of knowledge about the representation of knowledge; it provides for the representation of nonmonotonic reasoning rules; and it provides for the definition of objects, functions, and relations.","It was originally created by Michael Genesereth, Richard Fikes and others participating in the DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort. There have been a number of versions of KIF.","Although the original KIF group intended to submit to a formal standards body, that did not occur. A later version called Common logic has since been developed for submission to ISO and has been approved and published. A variant called SUO-KIF is the language in which the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology is written."]}
