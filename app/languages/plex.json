{"name":"PLEX","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PLEX_(programming_language)","description":["PLEX (Programming Language for EXchanges) is a special-purpose, pseudo-parallel and event-driven real-time programming language. Dedicated for AXE telephone exchanges, it was developed by G\u00f6ran Hemdahl at Ericsson. Originally designed in the 1970s, it has been continuously evolving since then. The language has two variants: Plex-C used for the AXE Central Processor (CP) and Plex-M used for Extension Module Regional Processors (EMRP).","Several precompilers or code generators exist, to produce source code in Plex-C from higher level languages or graphical models[citation needed]. These can generate Plex-C from:","Source code in Plex-C is compiled into the assembly language ASA210C. The binary form of ASA210C is either interpreted by a combination of hardware and microcode, or is compiled by a Just-In-Time compiler into native machine code for a high-capacity microprocessor.","Code execution is triggered by specific events, encoded as signals.","An example input string that has been designed for the LI3 (P83-P90) version of the AXE Switch could be STDEP:DEV=LI3-101&&-107; this would print to the users console the current device status (busy, idle, blocked, etc)",""]}
