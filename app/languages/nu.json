{"name":"Nu","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nu_(programming_language)","description":["Nu is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, with a Lisp-like syntax, created by Tim Burks as an alternative scripting language to program Mac OS X through its Cocoa application programming interface (API). Implementations also exist for Linux, and iPhone.","The language was first announced at C4, a conference for indie Mac developers held in August 2007.","Although being for the moment confined as a niche tool, possibly because of its Lisp-like syntax, it is generally considered stable, and is notable as part of a recent rise in use of functional programming languages.","This Nu code defines a simple complex numbers class.","The example is a basic definition of a complex number: it defines the instance variables, and a method to initialize the object. It shows the similarity between the Nu code and the equivalent Objective-C code; it also shows the similarity with Ruby.","This snippet, from the nuke tool bundled with Nu, also shows the influence of Objective-C, Lisp, and Ruby in the design of the language."]}
