{"name":"Vala","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vala_(programming_language)","description":["Vala is an object-oriented programming language with a self-hosting compiler that generates C code and uses the GObject system. Vala is syntactically similar to C# and includes useful language features like anonymous functions, signals, properties, generics, assisted memory management, exception handling, type inference, and foreach statements. It is being developed by J\u00fcrg Billeter and Raffaele Sandrini. It aims to bring modern language features to C[clarification needed][peacock\u00a0term], with no added runtime needs and with little overhead, by targeting the GObject object system. Rather than being compiled directly to assembly or to another intermediate language, Vala is source-to-source compiled to C which is then compiled with a platform's standard C compiler, such as gcc.","For memory management, the GObject system provides reference counting. In C, a programmer must manually manage adding and removing references, but in Vala, managing such reference counts is automated if a programmer uses the language's built-in reference types rather than plain pointers.","Using functionality from native code libraries requires writing vapi files, defining the library interfacing. Writing these interface definitions is well-documented for C libraries, especially when based on GObject. However, C++ libraries are currently[when?] not supported. Vapi files are provided for a large portion of the GNOME platform, including GTK+.","Vala was conceived by J\u00fcrg Billeter and was implemented by him and Raffaele Sandrini, finishing a self-hosting compiler in May 2006.","A simple \"Hello, World!\" program:","A more complex version, showing some of Vala's object-oriented features:","An example using GTK+ to create a GUI \"Hello, World!\" program:","There are various projects in various states of stability in order to provide IDE support for Vala:"]}
