{"name":"FOIL","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FOIL_(programming_language)","description":["FOIL was the name for two different programming languages.","The first FOIL was a CAI language developed at the University of Michigan in 1967. The acronym stood for File-Oriented Interpretive Language and it was very similar to other CAI languages like COURSEWRITER and PILOT. However, it tried to make the language somewhat block-structured using whitespace which ended up making the language vaguely similar to BASIC or ABC.","The second FOIL was a music generation language for the Touch\u00e9 computer instrument in 1979. The Touch\u00e9 was a keyboard that had digital tone generation and allowed you to program software for performances. The acronym stood for Far Out Instrument Language and was succeeded by MetaFOIL and FOIL-83. The language was developed by David Rosenbloom and was based on Forth.",""]}
