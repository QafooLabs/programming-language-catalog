{"name":"GPSS","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GPSS","description":["General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS) (originally Gordon's Programmable Simulation System after creator Geoffrey Gordon; the name was changed when it was decided to release it as a product) is a discrete time simulation general-purpose programming language, where a simulation clock advances in discrete steps. A system is modelled as transactions enter the system and are passed from one service (represented by blocs) to another. This is particularly well-suited for problems such as a factory. It was popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s but is little used today. GPSS is less flexible than simulation languages such as Simula and SIMSCRIPT II.5."]}
