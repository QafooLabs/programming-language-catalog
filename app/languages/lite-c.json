{"name":"Lite-C","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lite-C","description":["Lite-C is a programming language for multimedia applications and personal computer games, using a syntax subset of the C language with some elements of the C++ language. Its main difference to C is the native implementation of multimedia and computer game related objects like sounds, images, movies, GUI elements, 2D and 3D models, collision detection and rigid body physics. Lite-C executables are compiled instead of interpreted. Lite-C runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP or Vista operating systems.","Lite-C claims to allow very fast programming with a minimum of code, and easy access to non-programmers. For this, the developer provides a 25-lesson workshop that especially deals with the game and multimedia related objects of the language.","Lite-C supports the Windows API and the Component Object Model (COM); therefore OpenGL and DirectX programs can directly be written in lite-C. It has integrated the free A8 rendering engine.","The following lite-C program prints \"Hello World\", then plays a movie file and exits.","The following lite-C program opens a 3D window and displays a spinning sphere","Lite-C has the following differences to standard C:","Lite-C supports rudimentary classes and function overloading, but does not support advanced language concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, or operator overloading.","The lite-C language and compiler was originally developed in 2007 by Conitec, Inc. for Atari, Inc., with the focus on creating computer games by non-programmers. Since 2010, lite-C is also used for defining automatic trade algorithms in day trading software."]}
