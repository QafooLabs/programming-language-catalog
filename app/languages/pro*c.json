{"name":"Pro*C","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pro*C","description":["Pro*C (also known as Pro*C\/C++) is an embedded SQL programming language used by Oracle Database database management systems. Pro*C uses either C or C++ as its host language. During compilation, the embedded SQL statements are interpreted by a precompiler and replaced by C or C++ function calls to their respective SQL library. The output from the Pro*C precompiler is standard C or C++ code that is then compiled by any one of several C or C++ compilers into an executable."]}
