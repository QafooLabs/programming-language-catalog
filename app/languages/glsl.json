{"name":"GLSL","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GLSL","description":["OpenGL Shading Language (abbreviated: GLSL or GLslang), is a high-level shading language based on the syntax of the C programming language. It was created by the OpenGL ARB to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use assembly language or hardware-specific languages.","With advances in graphics cards, new features have been added to allow for increased flexibility in the rendering pipeline at the vertex and fragment level. Programmability at this level is achieved with the use of fragment and vertex shaders.","Originally, this functionality was achieved by writing shaders in assembly language \u2013 a complex and unintuitive task. The OpenGL ARB created the OpenGL Shading Language to provide a more intuitive method for programming the graphics processing unit while maintaining the open standards advantage that has driven OpenGL throughout its history.","Originally introduced as an extension to OpenGL 1.4, GLSL was formally included into the OpenGL 2.0 core by the OpenGL ARB. It was the first major revision to OpenGL since the creation of OpenGL 1.0 in 1992.","Some benefits of using GLSL are:","GLSL versions have evolved along side specific versions of the OpenGL API. It is only with OpenGL versions 3.3 and above that the GLSL and OpenGL major and minor version numbers match. These versions for GLSL and OpenGL are related in the following table:","The most recent version of the GLSL language is 4.20.6.","The OpenGL Shading Language provides many operators familiar to those with a background in using the C programming language. This gives shader developers flexibility when writing shaders. GLSL contains the operators in C and C++, with the exception of pointers. Bitwise operators were added in version 1.30.","Similar to the C programming language, GLSL supports loops and branching, including: if-else, for, do-while, break, continue, etc.","User-defined functions are supported, and a wide variety of commonly used functions are provided built-in as well. This allows the graphics card manufacturer the ability to optimize these built-in functions at the hardware level if they are inclined to do so. Many of these functions are similar to those found in the math library of the C programming language, such as exp() and abs(), while others are specific to graphics programming, such as smoothstep() and texture().","GLSL shaders are not stand-alone applications; they require an application that utilizes the OpenGL API, which is available on many different platforms (e.g., GNU\/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows). There are language bindings for C, C++, C#, Delphi, Java and many more.","GLSL shaders themselves are simply a set of strings that are passed to the hardware vendor's driver for compilation from within an application using the OpenGL API's entry points. Shaders can be created on the fly from within an application, or read-in as text files, but must be sent to the driver in the form of a string.","The set of APIs used to compile, link, and pass parameters to GLSL programs are specified in three OpenGL extensions, and became part of core OpenGL as of OpenGL Version 2.0. The API was expanded with geometry shaders in OpenGL 3.2 and tessellation shaders in OpenGL 4.0. These OpenGL APIs are found in the extensions:","This transforms the input vertex the same way the fixed-function pipeline would.","Note that ftransform() is no longer available since GLSL 1.40 and GLSL ES 1.0. Instead, the programmer has to manage the projection and modelview matrices explicitly in order to comply with the new OpenGL 3.1 standard.","This is a simple pass-through Tessellation Control Shader for the position.","This is a simple pass-through Tessellation Evaluation Shader for the position.","This is a simple pass-through shader for the color and position.","Since OpenGL 3.2 with GLSL 1.50 geometry shaders were adopted into core functionality which means there is no need to use extensions. However, the syntax is a bit different. This is a simple version 1.50 pass-through shader for vertex positions (of triangle primitives):","This produces a red fragment.","In GLSL 1.30 and later you can do","where:"]}
