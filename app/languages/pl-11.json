{"name":"PL-11","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PL-11","description":["PL-11 is a high-level machine-oriented programming language for the PDP-11, developed by R.D. Russell of CERN in 1971. Written in Fortran IV, it is similar to PL360 and is cross-compiled on other machines.","PL-11 was originally developed as part of the Omega project, a particle physics facility operational at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) during the 1970s. The first version was written for the CII 10070, a clone of the XDS Sigma 7 built in France. Towards the end of the 1970s it was ported to the IBM 370\/168, then part of CERN's computer centre.","A report describing the language is available from CERN.","This article is based on material taken from the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the \"relicensing\" terms of the GFDL, version 1.3 or later."]}
