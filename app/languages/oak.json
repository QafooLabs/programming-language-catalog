The language later evolved to become Java.","The name Oak was used by Gosling after an oak tree that stood outside his office.","In 1991, Sun Microsystems was attempting to develop a new technology for programming next generation smart appliances, which Sun expected to be a major new opportunity.","The team originally considered using C++, but rejected the idea for several reasons (see Java history).","Initially, Gosling attempted to modify and extend C++ but soon abandoned that in favor of creating a new platform called Green and an entirely new language, which he called Oak, after the tree that stood just outside his office.","By the summer of 1992, they were able to demonstrate portions of the new platform including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first attempt, demonstrated on September 3, 1992, focused on building a PDA device named Star7 which had a graphical interface and a smart agent called \"Duke\" to assist the user.","Oak was renamed Java in 1994 after a trademark search revealed that Oak was used by Oak Technology.Java 1.0 was finally shipped in 1996.","Oak was the basis for what Java 1.0 became later, but there were also some differences: Several concepts were planned in the Oak specification but remained not implemented in the original language because of time constraints:","Other concepts were different than, or improved later, for Java:","And finally some concepts were later scraped out:"]}
