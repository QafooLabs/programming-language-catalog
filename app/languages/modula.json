{"name":"Modula","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Modula","description":["The Modula programming language is a descendent of the Pascal programming language. It was developed in Switzerland in the late 1970s by Niklaus Wirth, the same person who designed Pascal. The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a module system, used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name Modula.","Modula was never released, and its development was discontinued after its publication; Wirth then concentrated his efforts on Modula's successors: Modula-2, Oberon, Modula-2+ and Modula-3. Although Wirth never released Modula, a compiler from the University of York, UK, was released."]}
