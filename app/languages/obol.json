{"name":"Obol","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obol_(programming_language)","description":["Obol is a high-level security protocol programming language at the Computer Science department of the University of Troms\u00f8. It is essentially executable BAN logic, i.e. it attempts to move the protocol implementation effort closer to the abstraction level where security protocols are analyzed. Thus it deals as little as possible with how messages are sent or represented, and instead focuses on content and transformations (e.g. encrypt\/decrypt, sign\/verify, send\/receive). There is no BAN-ish analysis involved, but the distance from a BAN logic-style idealization and analysis result to an actual executing protocol instance is significantly shorter than with general purpose programming languages like C or Java.","In its current form Obol is interpreted, implemented on Java via ANTLR. It features middleware-like components and allows invoking Common Lisp (ABCL) and Jython statemens.",""]}
