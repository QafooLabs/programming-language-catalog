{"name":"IBM HAScript","aliases":[],"wiki":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IBM_HAScript","description":["HAScript, or Host Access Script, is an IBM-developed macro language with an XML syntax designed for programmatic interaction with terminal-based applications. HAScript is based on a state machine principle. The first commercial implementation appeared in IBM's Host On-Demand in the late 1990s.","IBM software products that use HAScript include WebSphere Host On-Demand (HOD)[dead link], Personal Communications, and WebSphere Host Access Transformation Services (HATS). At this writing (late 2004) there has been some adoption of HAScript by other host access software vendors, although the language is not yet universal."]}
