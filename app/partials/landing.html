    <h3>What is the Meaning of this?</h3>

    <p>
        This application is not considered to provide any real or useful
        functionality. It is a simple small demonstration project for Googles <a
            href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS Framework</a>. If this
        application eats your cat, burns your socks or disintegrates your
        kitchen, I would not be surprised ;).
